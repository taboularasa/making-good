This is the theme that I use on my personal website. It's a theme for Wordpress. It's built with the Sandbox theme (http://code.google.com/p/sandbox-theme/) and Blueprint CSS (http://github.com/joshuaclayton/blueprint-css/). If you want to feel free to use it as is or add to it. It's not much of a theme so I would be surprised if you wanted to.
