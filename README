This is the theme that I use on my personal website. It's a theme for Wordpress. It's built with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sandbox-theme/">Sandbox theme</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">Blueprint CSS</a>. If you want to feel free to use it as is or add to it. It's not much of a theme so I would be surprised if you wanted to.
